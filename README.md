# Acclimate

This is a little web-app which helps me know what the weather's going to be like and tells me what I need to wear when out training on my road bike, so I don't need to think about it. Written in **pure JavaScript** a little jQuery, and PHP for Ajax requests.

## Deployment instructions

- Fill out the `TEMPLATE.api_keys.php` file with API keys for Weather Underground and LocationIQ, and rename to `api_keys.php`.
- That's it!
